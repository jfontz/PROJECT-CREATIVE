# Hover Color Matching

This project demonstrates a simple interaction where the background color of the body dynamically changes to match the background 
color of the child div being hovered over within a parent container.

## Description

When you hover over any of the child div elements inside the parent container, the body's background color will instantly match 
the background color of the hovered child div. This effect provides a visual connection between the child div and the body background, 
creating an interactive and engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the parent container and child div elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles for the parent container and child divs.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to dynamically update the body's background color.
